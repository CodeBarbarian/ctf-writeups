# CTF Writeups

Since I decided to focus on the technical aspects of hacking, I have decided to use a lot more free time to do CTF challenges and write down my different approaches to learn more about how I solve challenges.
Trying to work my way through the picoctf challenges now, starting on the picoCTF 2019, and moving upwards.
