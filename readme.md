# CTF Writeups


## Information
1. I will probably re-write some of these since I have forgotten to add the authors of the challenges on many of these, and to be honest... It needs some re-writes...
2. I am writing these as I am doing them, so quick and dirty. See the point above....
3. I will always prefer to fail 99 times, and learn something than complete all the tasks in one go.
