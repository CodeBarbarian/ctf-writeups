## Description
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44924

<br />

## Approach
1. Access the website.
2. Have a look at the available source through inspection (CTRL+U)
3. Found first part of the flag in index.html

```html
<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->
```
4. Found second part of the flag in mycss.css

```css
/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */
```
5. Found third part of the flag in myjs.js

```js
/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?f10be399} */
```

6. Combine them to the full flag, gets you:

```
picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?f10be399}
```


<br />

## Conclusion
Fun little challenge. Just inspect the source code and it will lead you towards where to look. Skills you will learn is to navigate available source code.
