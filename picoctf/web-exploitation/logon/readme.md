# logon

## Description
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/15796/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:15796

## Approach

1. Access the site, have a look in the source try different default usernames and passwords.

2. Okay we get logged in everytime we put a username and password in, or just the username or just the password or nothing. 

3. We always recieve the "No flag for you" at logon.

4. It is time to have a look in the inspector then.

* Nothing really interesting in the available source.
* Nothing interesting in the console

* Looking at the network we can see the cookie request headers. These are http cookies associated with the server. An intersting one is the admin cookie which is set to false. Let us see if we can use the storage tab in inspector to change it to true.

5. Okay, I did the following. Tested by logging in as Joe, and setting the flag to true (Needed the first letter in true to be in capital so True).

this produced the following flag: 

```
picoCTF{th3_c0nsp1r4cy_l1v3s_6edb3f5f}
```

## Conclusion
Don't store admin permissions as cookies on the client side? 

Fun challenge, always interesting to have use the inspector for different things!
